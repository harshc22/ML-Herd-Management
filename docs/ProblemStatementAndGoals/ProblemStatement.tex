\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Problem}

Dairy farmers face significant challenges in managing the health, productivity, and breeding outcomes of their herds. Traditionally, these issues are managed reactively, with farmers responding to problems such as health declines, breeding failures, or unexpected herd turnover after they occur. This reactive approach leads to inefficiencies, financial losses, and reduced herd performance. Our project, in collaboration with CATTLEytics Inc., aims to address these challenges by implementing a machine learning (ML) model capable of predicting breeding success rates and the likelihood of animals leaving the herd based on historical data. This model will help farmers transition from reactive to proactive herd management, improving overall farm productivity and decision-making. The model will integrate with CATTLEytics Inc.'s existing systems, allowing seamless adoption by farmers.

% information.}



\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\paragraph{Inputs} \ \\
\\
The software will use historical herd data related to health, productivity, and breeding outcomes. This data may include metrics such as individual animal health records, breeding attempts, and farm-specific environmental conditions. The input data will be fed into a machine learning model to generate predictions.

\paragraph{Outputs} \ \\
\\
The output will consist of predictive insights aimed at improving farm management. These will include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Predictions about the success of breeding attempts for individual animals.
    \item The likelihood of an animal leaving the herd.
    \item Alerts about potential health issues or productivity declines.
\end{enumerate}

The software will provide clear, actionable outputs to guide decision-making, presented in a format easily interpretable by farmers and other stakeholders.



\subsection{Stakeholders}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Farmers:} The primary users of the software, who will benefit from improved herd management and decision-making.
    \item \textbf{CATTLEytics Inc.:} The company that will deploy the software to its customers and provide ongoing support.
    \item \textbf{Animal Health Experts:} Professionals who may use the software to provide advice to farmers based on the predictive insights generated.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Bodies:} Organizations that may use the software to monitor herd health and productivity.
    \item \textbf{Dairy Production Companies:} Organizations that may use the software to optimize their supply chain and production processes.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Environment}

\paragraph{Hardware} \ \\
\\
The software will be deployed in farm management systems typically used on standard personal computers or servers. These systems may also interact with IoT devices used for real-time data collection on farms.
\paragraph{Software} \ \\
\\
The model will be integrated into CATTLEytics Inc.'s farm management platform,%
 leveraging their existing infrastructure. It will seamlessly integrate into the%
 farmers' existing workflow, ensuring compatibility with the tools and systems%
 they are already using.



\section{Product Goals}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|p{0.55\textwidth}|p{0.4\textwidth}|} % Boxed table with column widths
\hline
\textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Importance} \\ \hline
The model accurately predicts breeding success rates for individual cows. & The accuracy of predictions can be measured by comparing the predicted success rates with actual outcomes over a defined period (e.g., a breeding cycle). A target accuracy rate, such as 80-90\%, can be established to define success. \\ \hline
The model provides predictions on the likelihood of an animal leaving the herd. & This can be measured by tracking the model's predictions against actual herd turnover rates. A success threshold (e.g., 75\% accuracy or better) for predicting cows that will leave the herd within a specified time frame can be set. \\ \hline
The system integrates seamlessly into CATTLEytics Inc.'s existing platform. & Success can be measured by the time taken to complete the integration and the absence of major system disruptions post-integration (e.g., within a 1-month test period, there should be less than 1\% downtime or user-reported issues). \\ \hline
The system offers user-friendly, actionable insights for farmers. & User-friendliness can be measured through user feedback surveys post-implementation, focusing on ease of use and clarity of insights. A target of 80\% or more of users rating the insights as “clear” or “actionable” can be set as a measurable goal. \\ \hline

\section{Stretch Goals}

\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|p{0.55\textwidth}|p{0.4\textwidth}|} % Boxed table with column widths
\hline
\textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Importance} \\ \hline
The model processes real-time data to provide up-to-date predictions. & Real-time predictions allow farmers to respond quickly to changes in herd dynamics, preventing potential issues. \\ \hline
The system includes a feature for predicting long-term health trends of individual cows. & This would enable farmers to anticipate health problems and intervene early, leading to better animal welfare and reduced veterinary costs. \\ \hline
The model can be customized for different farm sizes and breeds. & Customization increases the model's marketability, allowing it to be adapted to various farm environments and specific herd characteristics. \\ \hline
The system offers encrypted data storage and transmission to ensure data security. & Data security is crucial for farmers and companies that handle sensitive herd information. This feature increases trust and protects data integrity. \\ \hline

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}
