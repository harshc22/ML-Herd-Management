    \item \textbf{Meeting Protocol}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Attendance}: All members are expected to attend unless unable, in which case they should inform the members ahead of time.
        \item \textbf{Minutes}: One team member will be assigned to take minutes, including key decisions, action items, and next steps. Minutes will be shared within \textbf{24 hours} after the meeting on GitHub.
    \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}


\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\subsection*{Liaison} Responsible for communicating with the industry supervisor, ensuring that the project is on track, and addressing any concerns or questions from the supervisor.   
\subsection*{Chair} Responsible for leading meetings, ensuring the agenda is followed, and managing time. Team members will take turns being the chair for each meeting.
\subsection*{Meeting Minutes} Responsible for taking minutes during meetings, including key decisions, action items, and next steps. Meeting minutes will be taken by a single member at a time, and the member taking minutes will rotate every week.
\subsection*{Machine Learning Lead} Responsible for leading the machine learning component of the project, including researching machine learning models, and ensuring that the machine learning component meets the requirements.
\subsection*{Developer} Responsible for developing the project, including coding, testing, and documentation. Developers must ensure that the code produced for the project is of high quality and is well-documented.
\subsection*{Tester} Responsible for testing the project, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. This role will be responsible for ensuring that the project meets the requirements and is free of defects.
\subsection*{Path to Changing Roles} Team members can change roles based on their interest, availability, and skill set. The team will discuss and decide on role changes as needed. Furthermore, any team member may be asked to help out anywhere else in the system if the need arises. For this reason, it is important that all team members stay up to date with context for what is happening with different parts of the team. Team members may fulfill more than one role at once.

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

A few potential challenges that may arise during the course of this project include the availability and quality of historical dairy farm data. While we will be provided with some datasets related to animal health, breeding success, and productivity, these may suffer from inconsistencies, missing values, or lack of relevant features. Our strategy to overcome this involves performing thorough data preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is suitable for building a reliable model. Additionally, the complexity of predicting outcomes like breeding success or the likelihood of an animal leaving the herd poses a challenge in terms of model accuracy. To address this, we plan to conduct some experiments using various machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate and robust model for these predictions.

For our POC demonstration in November, we will build a prototype model using a limited dataset that predicts breeding success rates. The POC will include a data pipeline that handles preprocessing steps, a prediction model that outputs breeding success probabilities, and means for displaying the predictions via a dashboard or command line output. This will allow us to demonstrate the viability of the system and our ability to overcome challenges related to data quality and prediction accuracy. In the final product, the model will be scaled to handle more complex data and generate additional insights such as health risks or productivity forecasts, but if the POC can show accurate predictions for a small subset of outcomes, it serves as proof that the system will work for more complex scenarios.

\section{Expected Technology}
\textbf{Initial Implementation Plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Programming language}: 
    The project will primarily use \textbf{Python} due to its strong support for machine learning and data science tasks. For web development tasks, the project will use \textbf{React}, a \textbf{JavaScript} library. 
    \item \textbf{Libraries}: 
    Expected key libraries include \textbf{Pandas} and \textbf{Numpy} for data manipulation, \textbf{Scikit-learn}, \textbf{TensorFlow}, or \textbf{PyTorch} for building the machine learning model, and \textbf{Matplotlib} or \textbf{Seaborn} for data visualization.
    \item \textbf{AI Model}: 
    The project will create a \textbf{custom AI model} specifically tailored to dairy farming data, focusing on predicting outcomes such as breeding success rates and herd attrition.
    \item \textbf{Linter}: 
    \textbf{Flake8} or \textbf{Black} will be utilized to maintain code quality and ensure adherence to Python's PEP 8 standards.
    \item \textbf{Unit testing framework}: 
    \textbf{PyTest} will be used to implement unit tests, focusing on validating data pipelines, model training, and prediction accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI)}: 
    \textbf{GitHub Actions} will be used to automate tests and ensure code quality in a continuous integration pipeline.
    \item \textbf{Version Control and Project Management}: 
    \textbf{Git} will be used for version control and \textbf{GitHub} for repository management and collaboration throughout the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Coding Standard}

The project will follow the \textbf{PEP 8} coding standard for Python, which is the official style guide for Python code. PEP 8 outlines guidelines and best practices for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code. Key recommendations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using 4 spaces per indentation level.
    \item Limiting line length to 79 characters.
    \item Proper use of blank lines to separate functions and classes.
    \item Consistent use of lower\_case\_with\_underscores for variable and function names.
    \item Avoiding extraneous whitespace.
    \item Using meaningful comments to explain the purpose of code blocks.
    \item Keeping code simple and readable, and adhering to Python’s philosophy of clarity.
    
\end{itemize}
