\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current state of dairy farming presents challenges in efficiently predicting
the health, productivity, and breeding outcomes of cattle. Farmers typically rely 
on historical records, but the analysis is done manually, often leading to 
reactive management. The existing systems do not utilize advanced technologies 
such as machine learning for predictive analytics. As a result, there is limited 
proactive management regarding milk production, breeding success, and herd longevity, 
which directly impacts farm profitability and sustainability.

The current solution environment lacks integration of large datasets from multiple 
sources, such as individual cow health records, breeding history, and environmental 
conditions, into a single system that can offer actionable predictions.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that will leverage 
historical herd data to predict important traits such as milk yield, breeding 
success rates, and the likelihood of a cow leaving the herd. This model will be 
integrated into a farm management system, providing farmers with actionable 
insights. The goal is to move from reactive to proactive herd management.

The model will use data such as the health, breed, and genetic history of both 
the mother and father to predict traits in calves. The software will be 
developed as part of a partnership with CATTLEytics Inc., ensuring seamless 
integration into their existing platform used by dairy farmers.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
The project will be divided into several key components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Preprocessing:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collection of historical data from existing systems, including 
        cow health records, breeding data, and productivity metrics.
        \item Cleaning and standardizing the data for input into the machine 
        learning model.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Model Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designing and implementing the machine learning model for trait 
        prediction (e.g., milk production, herd retention).
        \item Training and validating the model on historical datasets.
        \item Iterative testing and refinement.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Integration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrating the prediction model into the CATTLEytics Inc. farm 
        management system.
        \item Ensuring that outputs are presented in a user-friendly format 
        for farmers to make decisions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Testing and Validation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing the software in real-world farm environments to validate 
        predictions and refine the user interface.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Documentation and Training:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Providing clear documentation for users and training for farmers 
        to effectively use the system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

	      recommendations made by the model comply with Canadian regulations for
	      dairy farming (Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Dairy
	      Cattle) will require thorough review and potential adjustments during
	      development.
	      
	\item \textbf{Model Interpretability:} Farmers may need clear explanations for
	      how predictions are made to trust and use the tool effectively. Ensuring
	      the model’s predictions are explainable is an open issue.
	      
	\item \textbf{Performance Considerations:} The tool needs to be efficient and
	      scalable, handling large amounts of data without significant lag or
	      performance issues, especially as it gets adopted by multiple farms.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There are no fully ready-made products that address the predictive
	      capabilities being developed in this project. While tools like Lactanet
	      provide dairy farm data, they do not offer predictive models based on
	      genetic and health data. Lactanet data will be used primarily for
	      training the custom machine learning model.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Reusable Components}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Machine learning libraries, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, will be
	      utilized to develop the custom AI model for cow trait prediction.
	      Additionally, front-end libraries such as D3.js or React Tree
	      Visualization libraries could be considered for visualizing the
	      family-tree diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There are no existing products to be copied for this project. However,
	      open-source family-tree visualization tools might serve as inspiration
	      for the graphical aspects of the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introducing this system could change how farmers currently select sires
	      or evaluate herd performance. Some may resist adopting new technology
	      due to unfamiliarity.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The project will be integrated into the existing Cattleytics software,
	      which is already used to manage dairy farms. The machine learning tool
	      will act as an additional module within Cattleytics, allowing farmers to
	      visualize the family tree of cows and predict future traits based on
	      genetic data. Seamless integration with the current system will be
	      prioritized to ensure smooth adoption and ease of use.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users may face difficulties interpreting complex AI model outputs, so
	      ensuring the tool’s recommendations are easy to understand is key.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The tool will need to function effectively on standard farm computing
	      systems, which may have limited processing power or internet
	      connectivity.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Continuous updates may be needed to improve the model based on feedback
	      from farmers. Future updates may also need to address changes in farming
	      practices
\end{itemize}
