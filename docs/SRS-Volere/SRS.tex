\section{The Scope of the Work}
\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current state of dairy farming presents challenges in efficiently predicting
the health, productivity, and breeding outcomes of cattle. Farmers typically rely 
on historical records, but the analysis is done manually, often leading to 
reactive management. The existing systems do not utilize advanced technologies 
such as machine learning for predictive analytics. As a result, there is limited 
proactive management regarding milk production, breeding success, and herd longevity, 
which directly impacts farm profitability and sustainability.

The current solution environment lacks integration of large datasets from multiple 
sources, such as individual cow health records, breeding history, and environmental 
conditions, into a single system that can offer actionable predictions.
\subsection{The Context of the Work}
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that will leverage 
historical herd data to predict important traits such as milk yield, breeding 
success rates, and the likelihood of a cow leaving the herd. This model will be 
integrated into a farm management system, providing farmers with actionable 
insights. The goal is to move from reactive to proactive herd management.

The model will use data such as the health, breed, and genetic history of both 
the mother and father to predict traits in calves. The software will be 
developed as part of a partnership with CATTLEytics Inc., ensuring seamless 
integration into their existing platform used by dairy farmers.
\subsection{Work Partitioning}
The project will be divided into several key components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Preprocessing:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collection of historical data from existing systems, including 
        cow health records, breeding data, and productivity metrics.
        \item Cleaning and standardizing the data for input into the machine 
        learning model.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Model Development:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designing and implementing the machine learning model for trait 
        prediction (e.g., milk production, herd retention).
        \item Training and validating the model on historical datasets.
        \item Iterative testing and refinement.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Integration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integrating the prediction model into the CATTLEytics Inc. farm 
        management system.
        \item Ensuring that outputs are presented in a user-friendly format 
        for farmers to make decisions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Testing and Validation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing the software in real-world farm environments to validate 
        predictions and refine the user interface.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Documentation and Training:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Providing clear documentation for users and training for farmers 
        to effectively use the system.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
