\section{Cultural Requirements}
\subsection{Cultural Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The primary language for the product will be English, tailored
  specifically to Canadian dairy farmers. 
  \item All data and measurements will follow Canadian standards, including the
  use of liters for milk production, kilograms for weight, and hectares for land
  area Other relevant units such as Celsius for temperature and metric tons for
  larger quantities may also be used
\end{itemize}

\section{Compliance Requirements}
\subsection{Legal Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The project must comply with the \href{https://www.nfacc.ca/codes-of-practice/dairy-cattle}{Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Dairy Cattle}, which is a government-regulated standard in Canada. This code outlines mandatory guidelines for the ethical treatment, health, and welfare of dairy cattle. Any management recommendations or actions suggested by the machine learning model will align with these regulations to ensure ethical practices in dairy farming.
  \item The project must comply with
  \href{https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/pdf/p-8.6.pdf}{PIPEDA} (Personal
  Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) for any personal
  information related to dairy farmers or other individuals involved. This
  includes the handling of contact details, financial information, and other
  personally identifiable data.

\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introducing this system could change how farmers currently select sires
  or evaluate herd performance. Some may resist adopting new technology due to
  unfamiliarity.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The project will be integrated into the existing Cattleytics
  software, which is already used to manage dairy farms. The machine learning
  tool will act as an additional module within Cattleytics, allowing farmers to
  visualize the family tree of cows and predict future traits based on genetic
  data. Seamless integration with the current system will be prioritized to
  ensure smooth adoption and ease of use.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Users may face difficulties interpreting complex AI model outputs, so
  ensuring the toolâ€™s recommendations are easy to understand is key.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The tool will need to function effectively on standard farm computing
  systems, which may have limited processing power or internet connectivity.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Continuous updates may be needed to improve the model based on feedback
  from farmers. Future updates may also need to address changes in farming
  practices

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
